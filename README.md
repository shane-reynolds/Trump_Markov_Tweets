# Trump_Markov_Tweets

The purpose of this repository is to build a Markov chain using Donald Trump's tweets, and then output text that looks like a Trump tweet.

This project requires two libraries which are not native. The first is a twitter scrapper found here: https://github.com/kennethreitz/twitter-scraper, and the second is URLExtract from here: https://github.com/lipoja/URLExtract.

I will update this project as I develop my programming skills.
